        <h1>Europe's most beautiful towns</h1>
       <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/beautiful-towns-europe/index.html"> <img src="images/p1.jpg" alt="spectacular view image" /></a>
        <p><b>(CNN) — </b>Paris, Rome, Barcelona... Europe's cities are bucket list destinations, and rightly so. But the continent's small towns are a dream, too, with all the beautiful architecture and much of the culture you'll find in the big hitters, only with fewer crowds to share them with.</p>
        <p>Here are some of the prettiest small towns across Europe, from humble fishing towns to hilltop medieval power bases.</p>    
        <h2>Giethoorn, Netherlands</h2>
        <img src="images/p2.jpg" alt="Netherland'S image" title="Netherlands view">
        <p><em>Giethoorn is often called the Dutch answer to Venice. </em> <hr></p>
        <p>They call it the Dutch answer to Venice, but Giethoorn lacks one crucial thing that the Italian city has in spades: overtourism. As in Venice, life revolves around the water, here -- there are no cars in the center so the only way to get around is on foot or on the water.
            Take a boat tour around the thatched houses sitting on peat-filled islands. Hungry? Stop at the Michelin-starred restaurant Hollands-Venetië.</p>
        <h2>Guimarães, Portugal</h2>
        <img src="images/p3.jpg" alt="Portugal image" title="Portugal view">
        <p><em> Guimarães is sleepy today, but it was Portugal's first capital.</em> <hr></p>
        <p>Guimarães is crucial to Portugal's history -- it was named the country's first capital in the 12th century, and its medieval core remains largely intact, full of convents, grand old palaces and a crumbling castle, perched on top of a bluff.
            Like everywhere in Portugal, local bakeries make a mean pastel de nata, but here you should try the local speciality: torta di Guimarães -- a pastry filled with squash and ground almonds.</p>
         <h2>Roscoff, France</h2>  
         <img src="images/p4.jpg" alt="France's wonderful image" title="France">
         <p><em>Roscoff is one of the cutest port towns in France.</em> <hr></p>
         <p>Port towns can be grubby. Not lovely little Roscoff, though, in France's Brittany region, which built its fortune on maritime trade, including exporting its famous pink onions to the UK.</p>
       <p>Today, it's a center of thalassotherapy, using seawater to treat medical conditions, as well as a beautiful Breton town. Tiny fishing boats bob in the small harbor -- with a larger one, where ferries leave for Plymouth in the UK, further out.</p>
    <h2>Anghiari, Italy</h2>
    <img src="images/p5.jpg" alt="Italy view picture" title="Italy">
    <p><em>Anghiari's streets were designed for Renaissance-era warriors.</em> <hr></p>    
    <p>Hovering on a hillside near the Tuscan-Umbrian border, Anghiari is a delight -- a tiny walled town curling round itself as it clings to the landscape.</p>
<p>It's a pedestrianized warren of alleyways and roller-coastering streets, packed full of grand palazzi which were built by the mysterious, mercenary "men of arms" who lived here in the Renaissance period.</p>    
<p>Find out more about them at the Museo della Battaglia di Anghiari, which traces the history of a momentous medieval battle which took place on the plain outside town.</p>
<h2>Nafplio, Greece</h2>
<img src="images/p6.jpg" alt="Greece's view" title="Greece">
<p><em>Nafplio was modern Greece's first capital. </em> <hr></p>
<p>Gorgeous Nafplio straddles the Aegean Sea in the Peloponnese, with its Venetian-built castle thrusting into the water (in fact, there are three castles to visit here) and a pretty Old Town spooling out behind the old walls.</p>
<p>This was the first capital of modern Greece, so there are things to do in spades. There's a lido, if you want to take a safe dip in the sea, and if history's more your thing, the archeological museum contains items dating back to the Mycenean age.</p>
<h2>Mostar, Bosnia and Herzigovina</h2>
<img src="images/p7.jpg" alt="Bosnia view image" title="Bosnia">
<p><em> Mostar's bridge draws visitors from all over the region. </em><hr></p>
<p>Mostar's Stari Most, or "Old Bridge," built by the Ottomans in the 16th century, was long considered one of the finest examples of Balkan Islamic architecture.</p>
<p>Arcing high across the Neretva river, it's one of the most famous sights in the Balkans, and traditionally locals dive from the bridge -- today it's a stop on the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series.</p>
<p>The bridge was destroyed in November 1993 by Croat forces during the Balkan wars. A reconstructed bridge was built in 2004, and today, Mostar is a beloved destination in Bosnia and Herzigovina, and a popular day trip from Dubrovnik, over the border in Croatia.</p>
<h2>Mazara del Vallo, Sicily</h2>
<img src="images/p8.jpg" alt="Sicily image" title="Sicily">
<p><em>Mazara del Vallo is one of Sicily's prettiest fishing towns. </em> <hr></p>
<p>Sicily is a melting pot, and Mazara del Vallo typifies that. Founded by the Phoenicians nearly 3,000 years ago, it's seen myriad cultures flow throungh the island -- its Kasbah area is similar to a north African medina, there's a strong Tunisia community, and you'll be more likely to find couscous on the menu than pasta.</p>
<p>Its stand out attraction is the Satiro Danzante, or dancing satyr -- an ancient bronze statue fished out of the sea in 1998.</p>
<h2>Clovelly, UK</h2>
<img src="images/p9.jpg" alt="UK view image" title="UK">
<p><em>Donkeys used to be the only way to get around cute Clovelly.</em> <hr></p>
<P>Donkeys used to be the only way to get up and down the steep streets of Clovelly, a pretty fishing village in Devon, southwest England.
    Today, they still haven't managed to bring cars in -- it sits at the bottom of a 400-foot cliff. Instead, goods are transported by man-powered sledges -- and if tourists can't face the walk back up to the car park, they can grab a ride in a Land Rover instead.</P>
<h2>Dinkelsbühl, Germany</h2>
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="Germany image" title="Germany">
<p><em>Dinkelsbühl sits on Germany's 'romantic road.'</em> <hr></p>
<P>A cute historic center, timbered houses and stout towers -- Dinkelsbühl has it all. It sits plum on Germany's "Romantic Road" -- a route known for its ravishing towns.</P>
<P>Wrapped by medieval walls with a vast Gothic church, St George's Minster, it was the setting for Werner Herzog's film "The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser."</P>
